<body><article class="hiddenproof">To prove this, we will prove that \(A\) is row equivalent to \(I\text{.}\) The entries below the \((1,1)\)-entry \(a_{11} = 1\) can be changed to 0 by adding a multiple of row 1. Since row 1 has no other non-zero entries, the \((2,2)\)-entry is unaffected. Also, this row operation only affects the first column of \(I\text{,}\) below the main diagonal. Next, the \((2,2)\)-entry is the next pivot, which can be used to change all entries below it to 0 by row replacement. Similarly, the \((2,2)\)-entry is the only non-zero entry in its row of \(A\text{,}\) so the other entries, in particular the \((3,3)\)-entry, is not affected. Also, this row operation only affects the 2nd column of \(I\text{,}\) below the main diagonal. Continuing in this way, the diagonal entries are all of the pivots, and \(A\) is reduced to \(I\text{,}\) so \(A\) is invertible, and the augmented matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} I \mid A^{-1} \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\) Each row operation only adds multiples of the pivot rows to rows below it, so \(A^{-1}\) is unit lower triangular.</article></body>
