    <title>Vector Equations of Planes</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, we can also form a plane. However, it is not immediately clear how to form the Cartesian equation of a plane in space. Recall that a line is defined by a point, and a slope or direction. However, planes do not have a clear notion of slope, because the inclination of a plane depends on the direction you are travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we will consider the equation of a line in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, from the perspective of perpendicularity, and the dot product. Then, this reasoning will generalize to a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
        <title>Standard Form of a Line, and Normal Vectors</title>
        <p>
            Recall that previously, we specified a line using a point on the line <m>\vec{r}_0</m>, and a direction vector <m>\vec{v}</m>. Alternatively, we could have instead specified a vector that is perpendicular to the line <m>\vec{n}</m>, called a normal vector. Then, for any point <m>\vec{r}</m> on the line, it has the property that <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m> is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m> (previously, recall <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m> was <em>parallel</em> to <m>\vec{v}</m>). Using dot products, this means that,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} \bullet (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This is another form of the equation of a line. If <m>\vec{r} = (x,y), \vec{r} = (x_0, y_0)</m>, and <m>\vec{n} = (a,b)</m>, then this is equiavlent to,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>(a,b) \bullet (x - x_0, y - y_0) \amp = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) \amp = 0</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            This can be written more simply by expanding, and collecting the constant terms,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>ax - ax_0 + by - by_0 \amp = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>ax + by \amp = ax_0 + by_0</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            You may recognize this as the standard form of a line, typically written as <m>ax + by = c</m>. Also, in linear algebra, we prefer this form, because it connects to the form of a linear equation in terms of a linear system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, the line <m>ax + by = c</m> has normal vector <m>\vec{n} = (a,b)</m>.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
        <p>
            In a similar way, it turns out that a plane can be specified using a point on the plane, and a vector pointing out of the plane, again called a <term>normal vector</term>. Let <m>\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> be a point in space, and let <m>\vec{n} = (a,b,c)</m> be a normal vector for the plane. Then, for any point <m>\vec{r} = (x,y,z)</m> on the plane, it has the property that <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m>, which is a vector that line parallel to the plane, is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} \bullet (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This is the equation of the plane in vector form. Notice that this is the same as the equation of a line, except the vectors involved have 3 coordinates instead of 2. In terms of Cartesian coordinates,
        </p>
        <me>
            a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            Again, expanding, and collecting the constant terms, we get,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>ax - ax_0 + by - by_0 + cz - cz_0 \amp = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>ax + by + cz = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            Then, this can be written in the standard form,
        </p>
        <me>
            \boxed{ax + by + cz = d}
        </me>
        <p>
            where <m>d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0</m> (or <m>d = \vec{n} \bullet \vec{r}_0</m>). Notice the similarities to the standard form of a line, <m>ax + by = c</m>. Conversely, given the equation of a plane <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, the normal vector can be simply read off as <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Of course, the normal vector of a plane is not unique, as any multiple of <m>(a,b,c)</m> is also a normal vector of the plane.
        </p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Equation of a plane</title>
            <p>Let <m>\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> be a point, <m>\vec{n} = (a,b,c)</m> be a non-zero vector. Then, the equation of the plane through <m>\vec{r}_0</m> and perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m> has equation,</p>
            <me>
                \vec{n} \bullet (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0) = 0
            </me>
            <p>
                Or,
            </p>
            <me>
                ax + by + cz = d
            </me>
            <p>
                where <m>d = \vec{n} \bullet \vec{r}_0</m>. Conversely, the graph of the equation <m>ax + by + cz = d</m> is a plane perpendicular to <m>\vec{n} = (a,b,c)</m>, provided that <m>a, b, c \neq 0</m>.
            </p>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            If at least of the the scalars <m>a,b,c</m> are non-zero, then the equation represents a plane. Otherwise, the normal vector is the zero vector, and the equation becomes <m>0 = 0</m>, representing all of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There exists exactly one plane passing through <m>\vec{r}_0</m> that is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            From another perspective, by first starting with all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> in 3-dimensional space <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, and then by requiring the constraint equation <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, this constraint generally acts to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by 1, i.e. the result is a 2-dimensional object. It turns out that if this equation is linear (like the equation of a plane is), then the result will be a 2-dimensional <em>flat</em> surface, i.e. a plane. Similarly, in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, a single linear equation reduces the 2-dimensional plane to a 1-dimensional line.

        <title>Planes Using Two Vectors: Cross Product</title>
        <p>
            Another way of specifying a plane is to specify a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two non-parallel (non-zero) vectors <m>\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2</m>. Then, a normal vector to this plane is the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m>.
        </p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Parametric Equation of a Plane</title>
        <p>
            Similarly to lines, we can specify a plane in parametric form. Consider a point on the plane <m>\vec{r}_0</m>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes Using 3 Points</title>
        <p>
            Yet another method to specify a plane is to specify 3 distinct points on the plane. If the points are <m>(a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}), (a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}), (a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33})</m>, then a plane containing these three points, of the form <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, must satisfy the system,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrrrr}
            aa_{11} \amp + ba_{12} \amp + ca_{13} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{21} \amp + ba_{22} \amp + ca_{23} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{31} \amp + ba_{32} \amp + ca_{33} \amp = \amp d
            \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is a linear system in the 4 variables <m>a, b, c, d</m>. Here, there are 4 unknowns, and only 3 equations, so we expect that there are more than one solution. Performing row reduction, we can solve the system, and determine the coefficients of the plane's equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This works, as long as the points are not colinear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another method, which uses vectors, is to directly determine the normal vector. Recall that if we a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two vectors such that <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_1</m> and <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_2</m> are on the plane, then the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m> is a normal vector of the plane. Let <m>\vec{r}_0, \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2</m> be the 3 points. Then, we can use one point (say, <m>\vec{r}_0</m>) as the starting point. Then, the two points <m>\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0</m> and <m>\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0</m> are vectors which are parallel to the plane. Then, their cross product is a normal vector for the plane,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} = \brac{\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0} \times \brac{\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0}
        </me>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>
            In summary, a plane can be defined by,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A point and a vector perpendicular to the plane.</li>
            <li>Two vectors, that are not parallel.</li>
            <li>Three points, which are not collinear.</li>
        </ul>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes Parallel to the Coordinate Planes</title>
        <p>
            In <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, the <term>coordinate planes</term> are the planes spanned by the axes, the <m>xy</m>-plane, <m>xz</m>-plane, and the <m>yz</m>-plane.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the <m>xy</m>-plane is the set of all points with <m>z</m>-coordinate equal to 0, and so it's Cartesian equation is <m>z = 0</m>. Similarly, the <m>yz</m>-plane and <m>xz</m>-plane have equations <m>x = 0</m> and <m>y = 0</m>, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slightly more generally, the equations <m>x = a</m>, <m>y = a</m>, and <m>z = a</m>, for some <m>a</m>, represent a plane parallel to the coordinate planes, but <m>a</m> units above or below.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Intersecting Planes</title>
        <p>
            In almost all cases, two planes will intersect, and this intersection will be a line. Let <m>a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z \amp = d_1</m> and <m>a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z \amp = d_2</m> be the equation of two planes, with normal vectors <m>\vec{n}_1 = \veciii{a_1}{b_1}{c_1}, \vec{n}_2 = \veciii{a_2}{b_2}{c_2}</m>. Then, the line of intersection will be perpendicular to both normal vectors <m>\vec{n}_1</m> and <m>\vec{n}_2</m>. Thus, it will be parallel to their cross product. In other words, <m>\vec{v} = \vec{n}_1 \times \vec{n}_2</m> is a direction vector for the line of intersection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, it is sufficient to find a single point on the line. To do this, we can solve the system of equations,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z \amp = d_1</mrow>
            <mrow>a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z \amp = d_2</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            This is a system with 3 variables and only 2 equations, so we expect there to be infinitely many solutions. In this case, we only need a single solution, so it is easiest to choose a convenient value (typically letting <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, or <m>z = 0</m> in the two equations, and solving for the other two variables, resulting a solution, say <m>\vec{r}_0</m>. Then, the vector parametric equation of the line is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v}
        </me>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Parallel Planes</title>
        <p>
            Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel (or anti-parallel). If two planes are parallel, then they don't intersect.
        </p>
