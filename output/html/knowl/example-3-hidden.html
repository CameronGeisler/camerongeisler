<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Consider the matrix in REF,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \amp 0 \amp -5 \amp 1 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
</div>which is the augmented matrix of the linear system,<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
x \amp \amp -5z \amp = \amp 1 \\
\amp y \amp + z \amp = \amp 4 \\
\amp \amp 0 \amp = \amp 0
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>At this point, notice that the third equation is the true statement (or tautology) <span class="process-math">\(0 = 0\text{.}\)</span> Intuitively, this means that while there were originally 3 equations that constrained the possible solutions, one of those equations were superfluous. Then, any solution <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> only has to satisfy the remaining two equations. In short, there are 3 variables, but only 2 constraints. In this case, for example, if we choose an arbitrary value of <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(z = t\text{,}\)</span> then we can solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in equation 1 and 2, respectively, and get a solution of the system. In particular,<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
x = 1 + 5t \\
y = 4 - t \\
z = t
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
</div>Then, any tuple of the form <span class="process-math">\((1+5t,4-t,t)\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> is any number) will be a solution to the system. In particular, there are infinitely many solutions of the system. Here, <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is called a <em class="emphasis">free variable</em>, because it can take on any value to generate a solution of the system.</article></body>
