<article class="hiddenproof"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h4>To prove this, we will prove that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is row equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> The entries below the <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span>-entry <span class="process-math">\(a_{11} = 1\)</span> can be changed to 0 by adding a multiple of row 1. Since row 1 has no other non-zero entries, the <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\)</span>-entry is unaffected. Also, this row operation only affects the first column of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> below the main diagonal. Next, the <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\)</span>-entry is the next pivot, which can be used to change all entries below it to 0 by row replacement. Similarly, the <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\)</span>-entry is the only non-zero entry in its row of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> so the other entries, in particular the <span class="process-math">\((3,3)\)</span>-entry, is not affected. Also, this row operation only affects the 2nd column of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> below the main diagonal. Continuing in this way, the diagonal entries are all of the pivots, and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is reduced to <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible, and the augmented matrix is <span class="process-math">\(\begin{bmatrix} I \mid A^{-1} \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\)</span> Each row operation only adds multiples of the pivot rows to rows below it, so <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> is unit lower triangular.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-LU.html#proof-24" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
