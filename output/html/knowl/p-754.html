<div class="para">Then, suppose we want to consider many linear systems with the same coefficient matrix, <span class="process-math">\(A\vec{x} = \vec{b}_1, A\vec{x} = \vec{b}_2, A\vec{x} = \vec{b}_k\)</span> (note here <span class="process-math">\(\vec{b}_i\)</span> just denotes arbitray constant vectors, and not necessarily denote the column vectors of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>). To solve each of these systems individually would require performing row reduction and back substitution, so a total of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2n^3}{3} + n^2\)</span> for each system. Then, in total, this would be <span class="process-math">\(k \brac{\frac{2n^3}{3} + n^2}\text{.}\)</span> Instead, using LU factorization, we perform the row reduction once to determine <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> and determine <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> by the matrix inverse procedure. In general, computing matrix inverses is difficult, but for elementary matrices, there are very few non-zero entries, so the multiplication and inversion is very fast. Thus, in total, we will say about <span class="process-math">\({2n^3}{3}\text{.}\)</span>
