<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">Consider the possible subspaces of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> be a subspace. First, notice that if <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v} \in U\)</span> is any vector, then <span class="process-math">\(0 \vec{v} = \vec{0}\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is closed under scalar multiplication. Thus, any subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> must contain the zero vector. Indeed, the vector space containing only the zero vector <span class="process-math">\(U = \set{\vec{0}}\)</span> is a vector space. This can be trivially verified, since any scalar multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{0}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\vec{0}\text{,}\)</span> and any sum of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{0}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\vec{0}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Then, suppose <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> contains any non-zero vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d} \neq \vec{0}\text{.}\)</span> Then, <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> must also contain all scalar multiples of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> must contain the line parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\)</span> and through the origin. Indeed, this set, which is a line in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\)</span> or the span of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{,}\)</span> is a vector space.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
U = \span{\vec{d}} = \set{c \vec{d}: c \in \mathbb{R}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Indeed, if <span class="process-math">\(\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in U\text{,}\)</span> then they are both scalar multiples of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{.}\)</span> Then, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{u} = a \vec{d}, \vec{v} = b \vec{d}\)</span> for some scalars <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</span> Then, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{u} + \vec{v} = a\vec{d} + b\vec{d} = (a + b) \vec{d}\)</span> is also a scalar multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{,}\)</span> and so is also in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> Also, for any scalar <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\vec{v} = (cb) \vec{v}\)</span> is also a scalar multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{,}\)</span> and so is in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a vector space.</div> <div class="para">Next, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> contains another vector which is not parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vec{d}\text{,}\)</span> say these two vectors are now called <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_2\text{.}\)</span> Then, their span is a vector space. In this case, it makes up the entire plane <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In summary, the possible subspaces of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> are a single point (the origin), a line through the origin, and the entire plane.</div></article></body>
