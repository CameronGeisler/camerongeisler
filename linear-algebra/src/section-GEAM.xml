        <p>
            Performing Gaussian elimination with this matrix form removes the need of repeatedly writing the variables. This process on a matrix is also called <term>row reduction</term>.

            <li>Two matrices are <term>row equivalent</term> if one can be obtained from the other by a (finite) sequence of row oeprations.</li>
            <li>A <term>zero</term> row has only zeros. A <term>non-zero</term> row is a row with at least one non-zero entry.</li>
            <li>The <term>leading entry</term> of a non-zero row is the left-most non-zero entry. It is also called the <term>leading coefficient</term>, or <term>pivot</term>.</li>
        </ul>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Row Echelon Form</title>

        <p>
            After Gaussian elimination is performed on a matrix, the staircase or triangular form of the matrix is called row echelon form.
        </p>

        <definition>
            A matrix is in <term>row echelon form</term> (or simply <term>echelon form</term>, or <term>REF</term>) if,
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Any zero rows are the bottom of the matrix.</li>
                <li>the leading entry of every non-zero row is always strictly to the right of any leading entry above it.</li>
            </ol>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Matrices in row echelon form have the broad form,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} a \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
            0 \amp b \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp c \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp d \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        where the pivots $a, b, c, d$ are non-zero numbers. Notice that,
        <ul>
            <li>Every entry below a pivot is 0.</li>
            <li>The leading entries are <q>staggered to the right</q> as we go down.</li>
            <li>All zero rows are at the bottom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The terminology <em>echelon</em> is due to the step-like pattern of the non-zero entries of the matrix. The process of transforming a matrix into row echelon form is called <term>row reduction</term>. In summary,
        </p>

        <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} \text{doing operations on a} \\ \text{system of equations} \\ \text{to convert it to triangular form} \end{pmatrix} \quad \iff \quad \begin{pmatrix} \text{doing row operations on a} \\ \text{augmented matrix} \\ \text{to convert it to row echelon form} \end{pmatrix}
        </me>

        <definition>
            A <term>pivot position</term> in a matrix <m>A</m> is a location which corresponds to a leading entry in the row echelon form of <m>A</m>. A <term>pivot column</term> is a column of <m>A</m> which contains a pivot position.
        </definition>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Summary of Row Reduction</title>

        <p>
            Consider a matrix <m>A</m>. Broadly, row reduction involves going column by column, reducing the matrix to a simpler matrix at each step.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, determine the left-most non-zero column, which will be the first <em>pivot column</em>. In this column, choose a non-zero entry to be the <em>pivot entry</em>. If necessary, use a row exchange to positive the pivot at the top of the column.
                <me>
                    \begin{bmatrix} \mid \amp \mid \amp a \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    0 \amp 0 \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    \mid \amp \mid \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \end{bmatrix}
                </me>
                In terms of completing the algorithm, it doesn't matter which non-zero entry we select to be the pivot. For hand-computation, it is typically easier to select a 1 if that is available, as that will make the computations a bit more simple.
            </li>

            <li>
                Use row replacement operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot. That is, add multiples of the top row to rows below it as to remove all entries below the pivot entry.
                <me>
                    \begin{bmatrix} \mid \amp \mid \amp a \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    \mid \amp \mid \amp 0 \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \end{bmatrix}
                </me>
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the previous steps with the remaining submatrix below and to the right of the pivot,
                <me>
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    \mid \amp \mid \amp a \amp \ast \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp b \amp \ast \amp \ast \\
                    \mid \amp \mid \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp \ast \amp \ast
                    \end{bmatrix} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} b \amp \ast \amp \ast \\ 0 \amp \ast \amp \ast \end{bmatrix}}_{\text{submatrix}}
                </me>
                Repeat this process until there are no more non-zero rows to modify.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Finally, to convert the matrix to RREF,
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Starting with the right-most pivot, use replacement row operations to create zeros above each pivot. If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 using a scaling operation. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Steps 1-3 to convert a matrix to REF is called the <term>forward phase</term> of Gaussian elimination. Step 4 to convert it to the unique RREF is called the <term>backwards phase</term>.
        </p>

        <title>Remark on Gaussian Elimination</title>
        <p>
            Gaussian elimination, despite its simplicity, is one of the most important algorithms in linear algebra. Notice that Gaussian elimination is not really much more than high school algebra, but done in a systematic way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gaussian elimination is named after German mathematician <term>Carl Friedrich Gauss</term> (1777-1855), who developed the method in his work and helped develop the formal theory of matrices. However, similar methods of elimination were known as early as around 250-100 BC by the ancient Chinese. German engineer <term>Wilhelm Jordan</term> (1842-1899) helped popularize the method.

        <title>Systems with Infinitely Many Solutions</title>
        <p>
            If the REF of the augmented matrix of a system has a zero row, then the system has infinitely many solutions.
        </p>

        <example>
            <p>
                Consider the matrix in REF,
            </p>
            <me>
                \begin{bmatrix}
                1 \amp 0 \amp -5 \amp 1 \\
                0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
                0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
                \end{bmatrix}
            </me>
            which is the augmented matrix of the linear system,
            <me>
                \begin{array}{rrrrr}
                x \amp \amp -5z \amp = \amp 1 \\
                \amp y \amp + z \amp = \amp 4 \\
                \amp \amp 0 \amp = \amp 0
                \end{array}
            </me>
            At this point, notice that the third equation is the true statement (or tautology) <m>0 = 0</m>. Intuitively, this means that while there were originally 3 equations that constrained the possible solutions, one of those equations were superfluous. Then, any solution <m>(x,y,z)</m> only has to satisfy the remaining two equations. In short, there are 3 variables, but only 2 constraints. In this case, for example, if we choose an arbitrary value of <m>z</m>, say <m>z = t</m>, then we can solve for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in equation 1 and 2, respectively, and get a solution of the system. In particular,
            <m>
                \begin{cases}
                x = 1 + 5t \\
                y = 4 - t \\
                z = t
                \end{cases}
            </m>
            Then, any tuple of the form <m>(1+5t,4-t,t)</m> (where <m>t \in \mathbb{R}</m> is any number) will be a solution to the system. In particular, there are infinitely many solutions of the system. Here, <m>z</m> is called a <em>free variable</em>, because it can take on any value to generate a solution of the system.
        </example>

        <definition>
            Variables which correspond to pivot columns are called <term>basic variables</term>. The other variables are called <term>free variables</term>.
        </definition>
        
        <p>
            In general, for the augmented matrix of a system in REF, any non-pivot column corresponds to a free variable (besides the right-most constant column). Free variables can take on any value, and then we can solve for the basic variables in terms of the free variables.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Systems with No Solution</title>

        <p>
            If the REF of the augmented matrix of a system has a row which corresponds to a false statement, then the system has no solution.
        </p>

        <example>
            Consider the matrix in REF,
            <me>
                \begin{bmatrix}
                1 \amp -3 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
                0 \amp -1 \amp -4 \amp 7 \\
                0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2
                \end{bmatrix}
            </me>
            which corresponds to the linear system,
            <me>
                \begin{array}{rrrrr}
                    x \amp -3y \amp + z \amp = \amp 1 \\
                    \amp -y \amp -4 z \amp = \amp 4 \\
                    \amp \amp 0 \amp = \amp 2
                \end{array}
            </me>
            The 3rd equation is the false statement (or, <em>contradiction</em>) <m>0 = 2</m>, so the system has no solution. This is because, no matter what the values of <m>x, y, z</m>, it is not possible for the third equation to be satisfied. A solution of the system must make every equation true, so no such solution exists. Thus, the system is inconsistent.
        </example>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Reduced Row Echelon Form</title>
        
        <p>
            The row ecehlon form of a matrix is not unique, in that, by doing different sequences of row operations, the final row echelon forms can be different. However, we can continue to apply row operations in order to simplify the matrix further into <em>reduced</em> row ecehlon form.
        </p>

        <definition>
            A matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term> (<term>RREF</term>) if,
            <ol>
                <li>The matrix is in REF.</li>
                <li>Every pivot is 1.</li>
                <li>Every pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column.</li>
            </ol>
        </definition>

        <p>
            In short, RREF goes further than REF by requiring that every pivot is 1 (rather than just any number), and that there are all 0's below <em>and</em> above each pivot. A classic example of a matrix in RREF is a matrix of the form,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp a \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp b \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp c \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        <p>
            This represents a system of 3 linear equations in 3 unknowns. In particular the system,
        </p>

        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrrrr}
            1x \amp + 0y \amp + 0z \amp = \amp a \\
            0x \amp + 1y \amp + 0z \amp = \amp b \\
            0x \amp + 0y \amp + 1z \amp = \amp c
            \end{array}
        </me>
        In other words,
        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrr}
            x \amp = \amp a \\
            y \amp = \amp b \\
            z \amp = \amp c \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            from which the unique solution can be read right off as <m>(a,b,c)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Basically, RREF <q>builds in</q> the back substitution into the row reduction procedure. 
        </p>

        <example>
            Consider the system,
            <me>
                \begin{array}{rrrrr}
                2x \amp + y \amp + z \amp = \amp 1 \\
                4x \amp + y \amp \amp = \amp -2 \\
                -2x \amp + 2y \amp + z \amp = \amp 7
                \end{array}
            </me>
            which has augmented matrix,
            <me>
                \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 2 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\ 4 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\ -2 \amp 2 \amp 1 \amp 7 \end{array}\right]
            </me>
            After reducing to REF, one possible form is,
            <me>
                \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 2 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp -1 \amp -2 \amp -4 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp -4 \amp -4 \end{array}\right]
            </me>
            We could perform back substitution as before, but we can also instead convert to RREF. Doing so gives,
            <me>
                \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -1 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \end{array}\right]
            </me>
            from which the unique solution <m>(-1,2,1)</m> can be read right off.
        </example>

        <theorem>
            <title>Uniqueness of RREF</title>
            <p>
                Every matix is row equivalent to a unique matrix in RREF.

                A linear system is consistent if and only if the right-most column of its augmented matrix is not a pivot column. In other words, if and only if the REF of the augmented matrix has no row of the form,
            </p>
            <me>
