    <title>Inverse of a Matrix</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Recall that for real numbers, the <i>inverse</i> (or <i>multiplicative inverse</i>, or <i>reciprocal</i> of <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m> is the number <m>b</m> such that <a>ab = 1</a>. We denote <m>b</m> by <m>\frac{1}{a}</m> or <m>a^{-1}</m>. For example, the multiplicative inverse of <m>3</m> is <m>3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3}</m>, because <m>3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1</m>. Also, inverses only exist for non-zero real numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            For matrices, we can define an analogous notion of inverse. However, unlike real number multiplication, matrix multiplication is not commutative. Further, for both sides of the product to be defined, the matrices involved must be square. So, most often, we focus on inverses of square matrices. Also, similarly, the inverse of a matrix will only exist if the matrix is <q>non-zero</q> in some sense.

        <title>Inverse of a Matrix</title>
        <definition>
            An <m>n \times n</m> square matrix <m>A</m> is <term>invertible</term> if there exists an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB = BA = I_n</m>. Then, <m>B</m> is called the <term>inverse</term> of <m>A</m>, and is denoted by <m>B = A^{-1}</m>.
        </definition>

        <theorem>
            If a square matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, then its inverse is unique.
        </theorem>
        <proof>
            If <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are both inverses of <m>A</m>, then <m>AB = BA = I_n</m> and <m>AC = CA = I_n</m>. Then,
            <me>
                B = BI_n = B(AC) = (BA)C = I_n C = C
            </me>
            Thus, <m>B = C</m>.
        </proof>
        <p>
            Thus, the inverse of a matrix <m>A</m>, if it exists, is well-defined, and so is denoted by <m>A^{-1}</m>. It has the property that,
        </p>
        <me>
            AA^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I_n
        </me>

        <p>
            A matrix which is not invertible is sometimes called <term>singular</term>, and a matrix which is invertible is called <term>non-singular</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To verify that  matrix <m>B</m> is the inverse of <m>A</m>, we can multiply <m>B</m> by <m>A</m> and verify that the result is the identity matrix. Further, for a square matrix <m>A</m>, <m>AB = I_n</m> if and only if <m>BA = I_n</m>, so it is sufficient to only compute one of the two products <m>AB</m> or <m>BA</m>.
