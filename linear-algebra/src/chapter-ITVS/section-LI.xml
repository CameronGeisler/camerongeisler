    <introduction>
        The concept of linear independence is crucial to linear algebra.

        <title>Linear Independence</title>

        <definition>
            An indexed set of vectors <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n}</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> is <term>linearly independent</term> if the vector equation,
            <me>
                a_1 \vec{v}_1 + \dots + a_n \vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
            </me>
            has only the trivial solution <m>a_1 = \dots = a_n = 0</m>.
        </definition>

        <definition>
            Otherwise, <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n}</m> is <term>linearly dependent</term>. In other words, <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n}</m> is linearly dependent if there exists <m>a_1, \dots, a_n</m>, not all zero, such that,
            <me>
                a_1 \vec{v}_1 + \dots + a_n \vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
            </me>
        </definition>

        <p>
            The <q>zero</q> linear combination <m>a_1 \vec{v}_1 + \dots + a_n \vec{v}_n</m> where <m>a_1 = \dots = a_n = 0</m> is called the <term>trivial</term> linear combination. Any other linear combination is called <term>non-trivial</term>.
        </p>

        <example>
            <title>A single vector</title>
            <p>A set containing a single vector <m>\set{\vec{v}}</m> is linearly independent if and only if <m>\vec{v}</m> is non-zero. This is because the equation <m>a\vec{v} = \vec{0}</m> has only the trivial solution <m>a = 0</m> if <m>\vec{v} \neq \vec{0}</m>. If <m>\vec{v} = \vec{0}</m>, then <m>a\vec{0} = \vec{0}</m> has non-trivial solutions (any non-zero value for <m>a</m>).</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <title>Set with two vectors</title>
            <p>
                Consider a set with two vectors <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2}</m>, and consider the equation,
            </p>
            <me>
                a \vec{v}_1 + b\vec{v}_2 = \vec{0}
            </me>
            If <m>\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2</m> are linearly dependent, then at least one of <m>a, b</m> are non-zero. If say <m>a \neq 0</m>, then by solving for <m>\vec{v}_1</m>,
            <me>
                \vec{v}_1 = -\frac{b}{a} \vec{v}_2
            </me>
            In other words, <m>\vec{v}_1</m> is a scalar multiple of <m>\vec{v}_2</m>. Conversely, if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other, say <m>\vec{v}_1 = k \vec{v}_2</m>, then <m>\vec{v}_1 - k \vec{v}_2 = \vec{0}</m>. This is a non-trivial linear combination of <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2}</m>, and so <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2}</m> is a linearly dependent set.
            <p>
                Geometrically, two vectors are linearly independent if and only if they lie on the same line through the origin.
            </p>
        </example>

            In summary,
        </p>

        <theorem>
            <p>A set of two vectors <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2}</m> is linearly dependent if at least one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. Otherwise, if neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other, then the set is linearly independent.</p>
        </theorem>

        <p>
            To determine if a set of vectors <m>\set{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n}</m> is linearly independent, this involves solving the vector equation,
        </p>
        <me>
            a_1 \vec{v}_1 + \dots + a_n \vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
        </me>
        <p>
            for the coefficients <m>a_1, \dots, a_n</m>. Recall that this is equivalent to solving the homogeneous system <m>A \vec{x} = \vec{0}</m> where the columns of <m>A</m> are <m>\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n</m>. Then, row reduce the augmented matrix <m>\begin{bmatrix} A \mid \vec{0} \end{bmatrix}</m>. Recall that there is a non-trivial solution if and only if there is a free variable. Thus, in summary,
        </p>
        <theorem>
            Vectors <m>\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n</m> are linearly independent if and only if the system <m>A\vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> has only the trivial solution, where <m>\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n</m> form the columns of <m>A</m>.
        </theorem>

        <theorem>
            A collection <m>\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n</m> of two or more vectors is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors.
        </theorem>
        <proof>
            <p>Exercise.</p>
        </proof>

        <example>
            <title>Vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
            <p>
                Consider three vectors <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w}</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>. This set will be linearly dependent if and only if <m>\vec{w}</m> lies in the plane spanned by <m>\vec{u}</m> and <m>\vec{v}</m>.
