    <title>Introduction to Matrices, Augmented Matrix of a System</title>
    
    <introduction>
        Notice that a system of linear equations can be essentially represented by its coefficients. Given a system,
        <md alignment="alignat">
            <mrow>x \amp + 2y \amp = 5</mrow>
            <mrow>2x \amp + 3y \amp = 8</mrow>
        </md>
        it can be represented fully by the following array of coefficients,
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 5 \\ 2 \amp 3 \amp 8 \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        This array captures the essential information of the system. That is, the variables in the original system simply act as <q>placeholders</q>. As long as we keep track of which columns correspond to which variables, the array contains precisely the same information about the system as its <q>equation form</q>. Systems of linear equations can be conveniently and efficiently represented in this way. This kind of rectangular array of numbers is called a <term>matrix</term>.

        <title>Matrices</title>

        <p>
            Broadly, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, arranged in (horizontal) rows and (vertical) columns, and within brackets.
        </p>

        <definition>
            <p>Let <m>m, n \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Then, an <m>m \times n</m> <term>matrix</term> (read as <q><m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrix</q>) is a rectangular array of <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns of real numbers,</p>
            <me>
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \dots \amp a_{1n} \\
                    a_{21} \amp a_{22} \amp \dots \amp a_{2n} \\
                    \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \\
                    a_{m1} \amp a_{m2} \amp \dots \amp a_{mn}
                \end{bmatrix}
            </me>
            <p>Each number <m>a_{ij}</m> is called an <term>entry</term> (or <term>coefficient</term>, or <term>element</term>) of the matrix. Then, <m>a_{ij}</m> represents the entry in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The plural of matrix is <term>matrices</term></li>
                <li>Matrices are typically denoted by capital letters, like <m>A, B, C</m>, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Note that in <m>m \times n</m>, the number of rows is specified first, then the number of columns.

        <title>Augmented Matrix of a System</title>

        <p>
            Consider the linear system,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrrrr}
            x_1 \amp - 3x_2 \amp + 4x_3 \amp = \amp -4 \\
            3x_1 \amp \amp + 7x_3 \amp = \amp -8 \\
            -4x_1 \amp + 6x_2 \amp - x_3 \amp = \amp 7
            \end{array}
        </me>
        Recall that a linear system is, in some sense, completely determined by its coefficients. Here, this system is completely determined by the <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix which contains the coefficients of the variables, and the <m>3 \times 1</m> matrix containing the coefficients on the right-hand sides,
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -3 \amp 4 \\ 3 \amp 0 \amp 7 \\ -4 \amp 6 \amp -1 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ -8 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        More simply, it can be represented by a single <m>3 \times 4</m> matrix, containing all of the coefficients,
        <me>
            \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -3 \amp 4 \amp -4 \\ 3 \amp 0 \amp 7 \amp -8 \\ -4 \amp 6 \amp -1 \amp 7 \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        This is called the <term>augmented matrix</term> of the system. Notice that the variables <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m> are simply placeholders which align and separate the coefficients. Often, augmented matrices are written with a vertical bar separating the coefficients of the variables, and the column containing the constant coefficients,
        <me>
            \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp -3 \amp 4 \amp -4 \\ 3 \amp 0 \amp 7 \amp -8 \\ -4 \amp 6 \amp -1 \amp 7 \end{array}\right]
        </me>

        <definition>
            The <term>coefficient matrix</term> of a linear system is the matrix with entries given by the coefficients of the variables. The <term>augmented matrix</term> is the coefficient matrix with an additional column for the constant terms. The system,
            <md alignment="alignat">
                <mrow>a_{11}x_1 \amp + a_{12}x_2 \amp + \dots \amp + a_{1n}x_n \amp = b_1</mrow>
                <mrow>a_{21}x_1 \amp + a_{22}x_2 \amp + \dots \amp + a_{2n}x_n \amp = b_2</mrow>
                <mrow>\vdots \quad \amp \qquad \vdots \amp \amp \qquad \vdots \amp \vdots</mrow>
                <mrow>a_{m1}x_1 \amp + a_{m2}x_2 \amp + \dots \amp + a_{mn}x_n \amp = b_n</mrow>
            </md>
            has coefficient matrix and augmented matrix,
            <me>
                \begin{array}{cc}
                    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
                        a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \dots \amp a_{1n} \\
                        a_{21} \amp a_{22} \amp \dots \amp a_{2n} \\
                        \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \\
                        a_{m1} \amp a_{m2} \amp \dots \amp a_{mn}
                        \end{bmatrix}}_{\text{coefficient matrix}}
                    \amp 
                    \underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
                        a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \dots \amp a_{1n} \amp b_1 \\
                        a_{21} \amp a_{22} \amp \dots \amp a_{2n} \amp b_2 \\
                        \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\
                        a_{m1} \amp a_{m2} \amp \dots \amp a_{mn} \amp b_n
                    \end{array}\right]}_{\text{augmented matrix}}
                \end{array}
            </me>
        </definition>

        <p>
            Quite literally, the augmented matrix results from <q>augmenting</q> the constant terms onto the coefficient matrix.
