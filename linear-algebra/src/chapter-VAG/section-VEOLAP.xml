    <introduction>
        Sets of vectors can be used to represent various geometric objects in 2 and 3 dimensions. First, we will consider using vectors to represent lines in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, and then in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.

        <title>Vector Parametric Form of a Line in the Plane</title>
        <p>
            Recall that in algebra, a line is given by a <term>Cartesian equation</term>, e.g. of the form <m>y = mx + b</m>, where <m>x, y</m> are variables, and <m>m, b</m> are constants (<term>slope-intercept form</term>). More precisely, a line is an (infinite) set of points in the plane. In particular, the line <m>y = mx + b</m> could be represented as the set,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{(x,mx + b): x \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            That is, the set of all points of the form <m>(x,mx + b)</m>, where <m>x</m> ranges over all real numbers. The number <m>x</m> here is called a <term>parameter</term>, because it is a quantity which specifies each point on the line. Here, it happens to represent the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the line, but its label does not change the line. That is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{(x,mx + b): x \in \mathbb{R}} = \set{(t,mt + b): t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            both represent the same set of points, and the same line. We typically represent parameters by <m>t</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In linear algebra, we prefer the alternative form <m>ax + by = c</m> (typically called the <term>standard form</term> of the equation of a line), because it connects to the form of a linear equation in terms of a linear system. In this case, if <m>x = t</m> is treated as a parameter, then we can solve for <m>y</m> as <m>y = \frac{c - at}{b}</m>, and then the line is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\brac{t, \frac{c - at}{b}}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            By associating points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> with their position vectors <m>\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}</m>, we can formulate a line in temrs of an (infinite) set of vectors. That is, the line is given by the set of vectors,
        </p>
        <me> 
            \set{\begin{bmatrix} t \\ \frac{c - at}{b} \end{bmatrix}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Or,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ c \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\frac{a}{b} \end{bmatrix}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>


        <p>
            Consider the set of all vectors with the same form,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\begin{bmatrix} x \\ mx + b \end{bmatrix}: x \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, this vector can be rewritten in terms of the part which depends on <m>x</m> and that part which doesn't,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\begin{bmatrix} x \\ mx + b \end{bmatrix} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ mx \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ b \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ m \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ b \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>More</title>
        <p>
            Recall that in algebra, we typically specify a line by providing its slope, and a point on the line. Roughly, the point specifies a <q>starting point</q> for the line, and the slope specifies the <q>direction</q> the line points.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using the language of vectors, suppose we want a line to pass through the point <m>\vec{r}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix}</m>. This vector will act as a <q>starting point</q> for the line. Then, we specify another vector <m>\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}</m>, which represents the direction from the starting point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> which we want the line to travel. Then, consider adding some multiple of <m>\vec{v}</m> to <m>\vec{r}_0</m>. Say, of the form,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
        </me>
        <p>
            where <m>t \in \mathbb{R}</m>. The resuling vectors, for varying <m>t</m>, trace out a line in the plane. Then, we say that the set,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            is the <term>vector form</term> of the line. The vector <m>\vec{r}_0</m> represents a point on the line, and the vector <m>\vec{v}</m> is called the <term>direction vector</term>. Equivalently,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v}
        </me>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Affine Combination Form</title>

        <p>
            Let <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}</m> be vectors. Then, consider the line segment connecting the two heads of the vectors in standard position. The <term>midpoint</term> of this line segment is the point <m>\frac{1}{2}(\vec{u} + \vec{v})</m>. That is, the linear combination,
        </p>
        <me>
            \frac{1}{2} \vec{u} + \frac{1}{2} \vec{v}
        </me>
        <p>
            More generally, by varying the weights of this linear combination, but requiring that the weights sum to 1, we can reach every point along this line segment. Further, if we allow the weights to vary over all real numbers (but still require them to sum to 1), then we can access all points on the line extending in the direction of this segment. Equivalently, the line along <m>\vec{b} - \vec{a}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, if we are given two points <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}</m> in the plane, we can form the line between them by considering the set of all linear combinations of the vectors, where the weights sum to 1. We specify this by denoting one weight by <m>t</m>, and the other weight by <m>1-t</m>. Then,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{(1 - t) \vec{u} + t \vec{v}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Linear combinations where the weights sum to 1 are called <term>affine combinations</term>.
        </p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Lines in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
        <p>
            In <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, lines are slightly more complicated. Again, a line can be completely determined by a point (say <m>\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \in \mathbb{R}^3</m>), and a vector (say <m>\vec{v} = (a,b,c) \in \mathbb{R}^3</m>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If <m>\vec{r} = (x,y,z)</m> is any point on the line, then <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m> is parallel to <m>\vec{v}</m>. That is, <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0 = t \vec{v}</m> for some <m>t \in \mathbb{R}</m>. Then, the line can be written as,
        </p>
        <me>
            \boxed{\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v} \qquad -\infty \lt t \lt \infty}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is called the <term>vector parametric form</term> of the line. The vector <m>\vec{v}</m> is called a <term>direction vector</term>, because it is parallel to the direction of the line. Intuitively, this represents taking the point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> and adding onto it any scalar multiple of the vector <m>\vec{v}</m>, and this generates the line. More explicitly, we can compare components,
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
            <mrow>\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \amp = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 + ta \\ y_0 + tb \\ z_0 + tc \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            Then, by equating components, this results in the equations,
        </p>
        <me>
            \boxed{\begin{cases} x = x_0 + at \\ y = y_0 + bt \\ z = z_0 + ct \end{cases} \qquad -\infty \lt t \lt \infty}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is called the <term>scalar parametric form</term> of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the point on the line is not unique, because we could have chosen any other point on the line. Also, the direction vector is not unique, because any multiple of the direction vector specifies the same direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another method of specifying a line is by two points <m>\vec{r}_0, \vec{r}_1</m>. This is because one point can be used as the point above (say <m>\vec{r}_0</m>), and the direction vector is the difference between the points, <m>\vec{v} = \vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0</m>. Thus, the vector parametric form is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + t (\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0) \qquad -\infty \lt t \lt \infty
        </me>
        <p>
            Notice that <m>\vec{r}_0</m> is on the line, corresponding to <m>t = 0</m>, and the point <m>\vec{r}_1</m> is on the line, corresponding to <m>t = 1</m>.
        </p>

        <title>Cartesian Equation of a Line in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
        <p>
            Using some algebraic manipulations, we can eliminate the parameter <m>t</m>, to write the equation of a line in Cartesian form. Recall that,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{cases} x = x_0 + at \\ y = y_0 + bt \\ z = z_0 + ct \end{cases} \qquad -\infty \lt t \lt \infty
        </me>
        <p>
            Then, solving for <m>t</m> in each equation,
        </p>
        <me>
            t = \frac{x - x_0}{a} \quad t = \frac{y - y_0}{b} \quad t = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
        </me>
        <p>
            For every <m>t</m>, the three quantities on the right-hand side of these equations must be equal. That is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \boxed{\frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is the Cartesian equation of a line in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>. Really, it is two equations.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
        <p>
            The form of the Cartesian equation of a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> is not obvious. Recall that lines can be completely determined by their slope and a point on the line, or by two points. However, planes do not have a clear notion of slope, because the inclination of a plane depends on the direction you are travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using vectors provides insight. It turns out, a plane can be specified by a point on the plane, and a vector pointing out of the plane, called a <term>normal vector</term>. Given a point <m>\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and normal vectors <m>\vec{n} = (a,b,c)</m>, there exists exactly one plane passing through <m>\vec{r}_0</m> that is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>. This plane is the set of all points <m>\vec{r} = (x,y,z)</m> such that <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m> is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>. That is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} \bullet (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This is the equation of the plane in vector form. In terms of scalar coordinates,
        </p>
        <me>
            a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This can be written more simply by collecting the constant factors, and writing it in the standard form,
        </p>
        <me>
            ax + by + cz = d
        </me>
        <p>
            Here, <m>d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0</m>. Notice the similarities to the standard form of a line, <m>ax + by = c</m>. Then, given the equation of a plane <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, the normal vector can be read off as <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Of course, the normal vector of a plane is not unique, for example, any multiple of <m>(a,b,c)</m> is also a normal vector of the plane. If at least of the the scalars <m>a,b,c</m> are non-zero, then the equation represents a plane. Otherwise, the normal vector is the zero vector, and the equation becomes <m>0 = 0</m>, representing all of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            From another perspective, by first starting with all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> in 3-dimensional space <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, and then by requiring the constraint <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, this constraint generally acts to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by 1, i.e. the result is a 2-dimensional object. It turns out that if this equation is linear (like the equation of a plane is), then the result will be a 2-dimensional <em>flat</em> surface, i.e. a plane.
        </p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes Using Two Vectors: Cross Product</title>
        <p>
            Another way of specifying a plane is to specify a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two non-parallel (non-zero) vectors <m>\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2</m>. Then, a normal vector to this plane is the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m>.
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Parametric Equation of a Plane</title>
        <p>
            Similarly to lines, we can specify a plane in parametric form. Consider a point on the plane <m>\vec{r}_0</m>
        </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Planes Using 3 Points</title>
        <p>
            Yet another method to specify a plane is to specify 3 distinct points, which are not colinear. If the points are <m>(a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}), (a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}), (a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33})</m>, then a plane containing these three points, of the form <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, must satisfy the system,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrrrr}
            aa_{11} \amp + ba_{12} \amp + ca_{13} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{21} \amp + ba_{22} \amp + ca_{23} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{31} \amp + ba_{32} \amp + ca_{33} \amp = \amp d
            \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is a linear system in the 4 variables <m>a, b, c, d</m>. Here, there are 4 unknowns, and only 3 equations, so we expect that there are more than one solution. Performing row reduction, we can solve the system, and determine the coefficients of the plane's equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another method, which uses vectors, is to directly determine the normal vector. Recall that if we a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two vectors such that <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_1</m> and <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_2</m> are on the plane, then the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m> is a normal vector of the plane. Let <m>\vec{r}_0, \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2</m> be the 3 points. Then, we can use one point (say, <m>\vec{r}_0</m>) as the point. Then, the two points <m>\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0</m> and <m>\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0</m> are vectors which are on the plane. Then, their cross product is a normal vector for the plane,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} = \brac{\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0} \times \brac{\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0}
        </me>
