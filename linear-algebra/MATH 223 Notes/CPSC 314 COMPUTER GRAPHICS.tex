\section*{Interpolation}
Recall that the real world is continuous, but we often deal with discrete representations. Also, recall that converting continuous to discrete is called \textit{sampling}, and that converting discrete to continuous is called \textit{reconstruction}. Interpolation is a big topic. In particular, given data values, interpolate a smooth polynomial. Catmull-Rom interpolation. Applications of sampling include audio sampling, etc. Applications of polynomial interpolation include designing the body of a car, designing the curvature of characters in a font.
