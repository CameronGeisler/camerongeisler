    <title>Vector Equations of Planes</title>

    <introduction>
        In <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, we can also form a plane. It is not immediately clear how to form the equation of a plane in space. First, we will consider the equation of a line in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, from another perspective.

        <title>Standard Form and Normal Vectors</title>
        <p>
            In linear algebra, we prefer the alternative form <m>ax + by = c</m> (typically called the <term>standard form</term> of the equation of a line), because it connects to the form of a linear equation in terms of a linear system. In this case, if <m>x = t</m> is treated as a parameter, then we can solve for <m>y</m> as <m>y = \frac{c - at}{b}</m>, and then the line is given by,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\brac{t, \frac{c - at}{b}}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            By associating points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> with their position vectors <m>\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}</m>, we can formulate a line in temrs of an (infinite) set of vectors. That is, the line is given by the set of vectors,
        </p>
        <me> 
            \set{\begin{bmatrix} t \\ \frac{c - at}{b} \end{bmatrix}: t \in \mathbb{R}}
        </me>
        <p>
            Or,
        </p>
        <me>
            \set{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ c \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\frac{a}{b} \end{bmatrix}: t \in \mathbb{R}}

        <title>Planes in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m></title>
        <p>
            The form of the Cartesian equation of a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> is not obvious. Recall that lines can be completely determined by their slope and a point on the line, or by two points. However, planes do not have a clear notion of slope, because the inclination of a plane depends on the direction you are travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using vectors provides insight. It turns out, a plane can be specified by a point on the plane, and a vector pointing out of the plane, called a <term>normal vector</term>. Given a point <m>\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and normal vectors <m>\vec{n} = (a,b,c)</m>, there exists exactly one plane passing through <m>\vec{r}_0</m> that is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>. This plane is the set of all points <m>\vec{r} = (x,y,z)</m> such that <m>\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0</m> is perpendicular to <m>\vec{n}</m>. That is,
        </p>
        <me>
            \vec{n} \bullet (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This is the equation of the plane in vector form. In terms of scalar coordinates,
        </p>
        <me>
            a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
            This can be written more simply by collecting the constant factors, and writing it in the standard form,
        </p>
        <me>
            ax + by + cz = d
        </me>
        <p>
            Here, <m>d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0</m>. Notice the similarities to the standard form of a line, <m>ax + by = c</m>. Then, given the equation of a plane <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, the normal vector can be read off as <m>(a,b,c)</m>. Of course, the normal vector of a plane is not unique, for example, any multiple of <m>(a,b,c)</m> is also a normal vector of the plane. If at least of the the scalars <m>a,b,c</m> are non-zero, then the equation represents a plane. Otherwise, the normal vector is the zero vector, and the equation becomes <m>0 = 0</m>, representing all of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            From another perspective, by first starting with all points <m>(x,y,z)</m> in 3-dimensional space <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, and then by requiring the constraint <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, this constraint generally acts to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by 1, i.e. the result is a 2-dimensional object. It turns out that if this equation is linear (like the equation of a plane is), then the result will be a 2-dimensional <em>flat</em> surface, i.e. a plane.

        <title>Planes Using Two Vectors: Cross Product</title>
        <p>
            Another way of specifying a plane is to specify a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two non-parallel (non-zero) vectors <m>\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2</m>. Then, a normal vector to this plane is the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m>.

        <title>Parametric Equation of a Plane</title>
        <p>
            Similarly to lines, we can specify a plane in parametric form. Consider a point on the plane <m>\vec{r}_0</m>

        <title>Planes Using 3 Points</title>
        <p>
            Yet another method to specify a plane is to specify 3 distinct points, which are not colinear. If the points are <m>(a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}), (a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}), (a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33})</m>, then a plane containing these three points, of the form <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>, must satisfy the system,
        </p>
        <me>
            \begin{array}{rrrrr}
            aa_{11} \amp + ba_{12} \amp + ca_{13} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{21} \amp + ba_{22} \amp + ca_{23} \amp = \amp d \\
            aa_{31} \amp + ba_{32} \amp + ca_{33} \amp = \amp d
            \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
            This is a linear system in the 4 variables <m>a, b, c, d</m>. Here, there are 4 unknowns, and only 3 equations, so we expect that there are more than one solution. Performing row reduction, we can solve the system, and determine the coefficients of the plane's equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another method, which uses vectors, is to directly determine the normal vector. Recall that if we a point <m>\vec{r}_0</m> on the plane, and two vectors such that <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_1</m> and <m>\vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}_2</m> are on the plane, then the cross product <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m> is a normal vector of the plane. Let <m>\vec{r}_0, \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2</m> be the 3 points. Then, we can use one point (say, <m>\vec{r}_0</m>) as the point. Then, the two points <m>\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0</m> and <m>\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0</m> are vectors which are on the plane. Then, their cross product is a normal vector for the plane,

        <me>
            \vec{n} = \brac{\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_0} \times \brac{\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_0}
